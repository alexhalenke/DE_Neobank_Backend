## Project Goal

A neobank gathered data of 2.7 million transactions. In this project we create a ELT pipeline for the data to enable the use of data analytics and visualization. 
The engineering challenges are the following: 
  - Extracting the data from the different data sources (csv files)
  - Storing the data in data warehouse
  - Data modelling according to the business requirements
  - Connecting to an interactive Dashboard 
  - Connecting a LLM to the database
  - Making the process scalable and auto scheduled
